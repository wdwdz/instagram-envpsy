This is a photo of the sidewalk where I live in Ithaca. I think looking at sidewalks when it starts snowing and they need to be salted is a cool junction of territoriality and environmental cognition. Here in Ithaca, salting the sidewalks is something that is dependent on residents or on the university. The university is very prompt and thorough about salting the sidewalks and paths, but they also only go so far as to salt the ones which they are responsible for. Past that—sidewalks in collegetown and off campus—individual residents are the ones responsible for salting. So, not only does the promptness and thoroughness of salting the sidewalks reflect the residents who live there (territoriality) it also reflects where campus starts and ends (environmental cognition).
