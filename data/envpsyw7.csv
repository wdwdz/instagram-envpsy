(I just got out of a 2 week quarantine so here is an old picture) Sitting at the top of the slope and being able to see the natural landscape helps clear my mind of stress. It always helps to be in an open green space and look at nature instead of working indoors for too long and feeling stuffy. I wasn’t able to do these sorts of things during my quarantine and there were times that I just wanted to go outside to refresh my mind because being inside could be so stuffy.","envpsyw7, envpsy",,https://instagram.fgua3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/129743647_136087704735251_1447381068499743125_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fgua3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=EL0f0a4v2GQAX_pywbh&tp=1&oh=89986f8de287f4728dcd4637ed334387&oe=5FFC5BF0
