As we discussed last class, where you sit can often determine your interaction and the perception of others. In the instance of side sitting, it is often presumed that a pair is romantically involved. In this photo, I have used my dog to illustrate how proximity can affect perception. Additionally, I have attached photos from Larry David’s show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, in which he runs into some trouble due to his seating choices. #envpsy #envpsyw6","envpsy, envpsyw6",,https://scontent-scl2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/128849095_132858568601892_8415977102563979018_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-scl2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=sIMuWfx9giAAX-81eqj&tp=1&oh=2edfcfced5d573b021cd77cfdb818764&oe=5FFDB237

This is the inside of the case of the new headphones I got. It can be awkward and difficult to imagine how a pair of headphones fits into a rectangular case, which is why I think Bose did an excellent job providing a schema on the top tag that shows how the headphones fit into the case. The schema excels in a number of cognitive ergonomics principles: (1) it’s available; it’s printed right where you need it when putting the headphones away. (2) it affords the user a great deal of understanding as to the actual configuration the headphones need to be in to be put away; in other words, you can make sense of it. I imagine that Bose maybe didn’t have this tag printed initially and then perhaps did consumer tests where people would pull the headphones out of the case and then immediately forget how to put them back.
