For this reason, there is almost always people making noise or able to see into my living room. The ability for people to see into the apartment from the parking garage is an example of crowding by vision. This crowding, paired with the noise occurring on the street, creates an environmental stress.

Environmental stress occurs when environmental demand is greater than individual resources. Stress can manifest itself in different ways and arise from different causes. Crowding and noise are two examples of environmental stressors

A friend and I observed this beautiful piece in a coffee shop over the weekend. Although this does not relate directly to cities (the unit we are going over in the course), it does relate to environmental perception. Both my friend and I have different ways we evaluate and see the environment, as well as how we store information and memories. Our eyes don’t ever really see the same thing the way a camera does. This is because our eyes are subjective. The same goes for the rest of our senses. Because of this, as well as changes in mental processing, we will never experience anything exactly the way someone else has.
