This district also features many commercial and food opportunities which draws people in and further distinguishes the Commons from its surrounding residential areas. These commercial activities lead to creation of the Commons’ commercial identity.

Sidewalks are an essential component of the urban environment and serve as key corridors for transportation. A lack of sidewalk maintenance makes walking difficult for pedestrians. In this example, Cornell’s campus features numerous stoplights, clean sidewalks, and bike lanes. In addition, the presence of trees and pleasant scenery makes the pedestrian feel closer to nature. These sidewalks also encourage physical activity and exercise.","envpsy, envpsyw3",,https://instagram.fmnl17-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/124399488_1234036073637352_5126895109761169666_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmnl17-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=kr1UNbINyVsAX8dw6Kt&tp=1&oh=e314fbf462bf8fd9e679bd3959c41662&oe=5FFCFC86

Porches in these developments especially are designed with the intention of fostering transparency and initiating accidental social connection. Though I do not live in a New Urban neighborhood, the porch enabled me to enjoy a pleasant, albeit brief, social interaction anyway.","envpsy, envpsyw3",,https://instagram.fuio1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/124038349_360731688336163_7393847696242352755_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fuio1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=oplD1sSRiucAX8WRxh_&tp=1&oh=a8bad8e1c7c2f15bd042ffff2900dc35&oe=5FFA5A0A

This is a picture of the porch at the house I live at. It is a good example of the gradient between private (inside) and public (sidewalk) space and allows us as residents to regulate how much privacy we want. Sometimes, especially when weather permits, we sit outside to do schoolwork or socialize or eat. When we are out on the porch not only do we have additional eyes on the street (HER Process: Defensible Space) but we are also able to interact with aspects of the neighborhood like our neighbors or the mailman (not unlike the principle at play in “Co-Housing,” one of the alternatives to suburbs we discussed in lecture).
With COVID going on as well, this gradient between private and public is even more important since interacting with someone in your home vs outdoors has a much different threat of transmission. I know here where I live there is a very small and specific list of qualified users allowed in the house without masks. On the porch, the list of qualified users (with masks on) is slightly larger.

If trends in BMI in the USA continue, by 2050, four out of ten American adults will become obese. One way to prevent this future possibility is to design neighborhoods that facilitate physical activity. Giving more priority to bicycle traffic increases the likelihood that people will engage in physical activity. Creating bicycle lanes makes areas more pedestrian oriented.","envpsy, envpsyw3",,https://scontent-frx5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/123708912_218513962954390_5025951454115844614_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-frx5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=a7YRvIiyVNoAX8wgFEn&tp=1&oh=0a9298b42a9d8080e46bf8c92012482d&oe=5FFD6E39
