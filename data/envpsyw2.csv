I would classify it as a node because it is at the intersection between West Campus and central campus— it’s a relatively large node at that.

My dorm has poor legibility in its layout and low environmental cognition. Examples of this are the room numbering system is not intuitive, and hallways branch of at unpredictable points.

As a result, the dorm tries to compensate for poor schemata by adding lots of signs. However, this is not the best way to resolve the problem because it adds to much information in an ineffective way.
